<p>is the Japanese traditional custom of enjoying the beauty of flowers, &quot;flower&quot; in this case almost always meaning <a href="cherry_blossom" title="wikilink">cherry blossoms</a> or <a href="Prunus_mume" title="wikilink">ume blossoms</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From the end of March to early May, sakura bloom all over Japan,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and around the first of February on the island of Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The  is announced each year by the weather bureau, and is watched carefully by those planning <em>hanami</em> as the blossoms only last a week or two. In modern-day Japan, <em>hanami</em> mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. <em>Hanami</em> at night is called . In many places such as <a href="Ueno_Park" title="wikilink">Ueno Park</a> temporary <a href="paper_lantern" title="wikilink">paper lanterns</a> are hung for the purpose of <em>yozakura</em>. On the island of Okinawa, decorative electric lanterns are hung in the trees for evening enjoyment, such as on the trees ascending Mt. Yae, near Motobu Town, or at Nakajin Castle.</p>
<p>A more <a href="History_of_Japan" title="wikilink">ancient</a> form of <em>hanami</em> also exists in Japan, which is enjoying the <a href="plum" class="uri" title="wikilink">plum</a> blossoms (梅 <em><a href="ume" class="uri" title="wikilink">ume</a></em>) instead. This kind of <em>hanami</em> is popular among older people, because they are more calm than the sakura parties, which usually involve younger people and can sometimes be very crowded and noisy.</p>

<p>The practice of <em>hanami</em> is many centuries old. The custom is said to have started during the <a href="Nara_Period" title="wikilink">Nara Period</a> (710&amp;ndash;794) when it was <em><a href="ume" class="uri" title="wikilink">ume</a></em> blossoms that people admired in the beginning. But by the <a href="Heian_Period" title="wikilink">Heian Period</a> (794&amp;ndash;1185), sakura came to attract more attention and <em>hanami</em> was synonymous with sakura.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, in <a href="Tanka_(poetry)" title="wikilink">tanka</a> and <a href="haiku" class="uri" title="wikilink">haiku</a>, &quot;flowers&quot; meant &quot;sakura.&quot;</p>
<p><em>Hanami</em> was first used as a term analogous to cherry blossom viewing in the Heian era <a href="novel" class="uri" title="wikilink">novel</a> <em><a href="Tale_of_Genji" title="wikilink">Tale of Genji</a></em>. Whilst a <a href="wisteria" class="uri" title="wikilink">wisteria</a> viewing party was also described, from this point on the terms &quot;hanami&quot; and &quot;flower party&quot; were only used to describe cherry blossom viewing.</p>
<p>Sakura originally was used to divine that year's harvest as well as announce the rice-planting season. People believed in <em><a href="kami" class="uri" title="wikilink">kami</a></em> inside the trees and made offerings. Afterwards, they partook of the offering with <a href="sake" class="uri" title="wikilink">sake</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Emperor_Saga" title="wikilink">Emperor Saga</a> of the Heian Period adopted this practice, and held flower-viewing parties with sake and feasts underneath the blossoming boughs of sakura trees in the <a href="Imperial_Court_in_Kyoto" title="wikilink">Imperial Court in Kyoto</a>. <a href="Poetry" title="wikilink">Poems</a> would be written praising the delicate flowers, which were seen as a metaphor for life itself, luminous and beautiful yet fleeting and ephemeral. This was said to be the origin of hanami in Japan.</p>
<p>The custom was originally limited to the elite of the Imperial Court, but soon spread to <a href="samurai" class="uri" title="wikilink">samurai</a> society and, by the <a href="Edo_period" title="wikilink">Edo period</a>, to the common people as well. <a href="Tokugawa_Yoshimune" title="wikilink">Tokugawa Yoshimune</a> planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the sakura trees, people had lunch and drank sake in cheerful feasts.</p>
<p><img src="Kamogawa hanami.jpg" title="fig:Hanami parties along the Kamo River" alt="Hanami parties along the Kamo River" /> Today, the Japanese people continue the tradition of <em>hanami</em>, gathering in great numbers wherever the flowering trees are found. Thousands of people fill the parks to hold feasts under the flowering trees, and sometimes these parties go on until late at night. In more than half of Japan, the cherry blossoming period coincides with the beginning of the school and <a href="fiscal_year" title="wikilink">fiscal years</a>, and so welcoming parties are often opened with <em>hanami</em>. The Japanese people continue the tradition of <em>hanami</em> by taking part in the processional walks through the parks. This is a form of retreat for <a href="Contemplation" title="wikilink">contemplating</a> and renewing their spirits.</p>
<p>The teasing proverb  hints at the real priorities for most cherry blossom viewers, meaning that people are more interested in the food and drinks accompanying a hanami party than actually viewing the flowers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; (A <a href="pun" title="wikilink">punning</a> variation, , is the title of a <a href="manga" class="uri" title="wikilink">manga</a> and <a href="anime" class="uri" title="wikilink">anime</a> series.)</p>
<p><em>Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees!</em> is a popular saying about hanami, after the opening sentence of the 1925 short story &quot;Under the Cherry Trees&quot; by <a href="Motojirō_Kajii" title="wikilink">Motojirō Kajii</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Emperor_Saga" title="wikilink">Emperor Saga</a> (嵯峨天皇 <em>Saga-tennō</em>) (786-842) of the Heian Period adopted this custom, and celebrated parties to view the flowers with sake and feasts under the blossoming branches of sakura trees in the Imperial Court in Kyoto. This was said to be the origin of <em>hanami</em> in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Poems were written praising the delicate flowers, which were seen as a metaphor for life itself; beautiful, but lasting for a very short time. This &quot;temporary&quot; view of life is very popular in Japanese culture and is usually considered as an admirable form of existence; for example, in the samurai's principle of life ending when it's still beautiful and strong, instead of slowly getting old and weak. The Heian era poets used to write poems about how much easier things would be in spring without the sakura blossoms, because their existence reminded us that life is very short.</p>
<p><img src="UenoParkHanami.jpg" title="fig:Hanami celebrations in Ueno Park, Tokyo" alt="Hanami celebrations in Ueno Park, Tokyo" /> Hanami was used as a term that meant &quot;cherry blossom viewing&quot; for the first time in the Heian era novel <em><a href="Tale_of_Genji" title="wikilink">Tale of Genji</a></em> (chapter 8, 花宴 <em>Hana no En, &quot;Under the Cherry Blossoms&quot;</em>).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, in <em><a href="tanka" class="uri" title="wikilink">tanka</a></em> (短歌) and in <em><a href="haiku" class="uri" title="wikilink">haiku</a></em> (俳句) <a href="Japanese_poetry" title="wikilink">poetry</a>, &quot;flowers&quot; meant &quot;sakura&quot;, and the terms &quot;hanami&quot; and &quot;flower party&quot; were only used to mean sakura blossom viewing.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning, the custom was followed only by the Imperial Court, but the <a href="samurai" class="uri" title="wikilink">samurai</a> nobility also began celebrating it during the <a href="History_of_Japan#Azuchi-Momoyama_period" title="wikilink">Azuchi-Momoyama Period</a> (1568–1600). In those years, <a href="Toyotomi_Hideyoshi" title="wikilink">Toyotomi Hideyoshi</a> gave great hanami parties in <a href="Yoshino" class="uri" title="wikilink">Yoshino</a> and <a href="Daigo" class="uri" title="wikilink">Daigo</a>, and the festivity became very popular through all the <a href="Asiatic_Society_of_Japan" title="wikilink">Japanese society</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that, <a href="Rice_production_in_Japan" title="wikilink">farmers</a> began their own custom of climbing nearby mountains in the springtime and having lunch under the blooming cherry trees. This practice, called then as the &quot;spring mountain trip&quot;, combined itself with that of the nobles' to form the urban culture of hanami.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By the <a href="History_of_Japan#Edo_Period" title="wikilink">Edo Period</a> (1600–1867), all the common people took part in the celebrations, in part because <a href="Tokugawa_Yoshimune" title="wikilink">Tokugawa Yoshimune</a> planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the sakura trees, people had lunch and drank <a href="sake" class="uri" title="wikilink">sake</a> in cheerful feasts.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>

Thousands of people fill the parks to hold feasts under the flowering trees, and sometimes these parties go on until late at night. In more than half of Japan, the cherry blossoming days come at the same time of the beginning of school and work after vacation, and so welcoming parties are often opened with <em>hanami</em>. Usually, people go to the parks to keep the best places to celebrate <em>hanami</em> with friends, family, and company broken coworkers many hours or even days before. In cities like Tokyo, it's also common to have celebrations under the sakura at night. <em>Hanami</em> at night is called <em>yozakura</em> (夜桜, literally &quot;<em>night sakura</em>&quot;). In many places such as <a href="Ueno_Park" title="wikilink">Ueno Park</a>, temporary paper lanterns are hung to have yozakura.</p>
<p>The blossom forecast (桜前線 <em>sakurazensen</em>, literally &quot;<em>cherry blossom front</em>&quot;) is announced each year by the <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a>,&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is watched with attention by those who plan to celebrate hanami because the blossoms last for very little time, usually no more than two weeks. The first cherry blossoms happen in the <a href="subtropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">subtropical</a> southern islands of <a href="Okinawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Okinawa</a>, while on the northern island of <a href="Hokkaido" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hokkaido</a>, they bloom much later. In most large cities like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, the cherry blossom season normally takes place around the end of March and the beginning of April. The television and <a href="newspaper" title="wikilink">newspapers</a> closely follow this &quot;cherry blossom front&quot;, as it slowly moves from South to North.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <em>hanami</em> celebrations usually involve eating and drinking, and playing and listening music. Some special dishes are prepared and eaten at the occasion, like <em><a href="dango" class="uri" title="wikilink">dango</a></em> and <em><a href="bento" class="uri" title="wikilink">bento</a></em>, and it's common for <a href="sake" class="uri" title="wikilink">sake</a> to be drunk as part of the festivity. The <a href="proverb" class="uri" title="wikilink">proverb</a> &quot;<em><a href="dumpling" title="wikilink">dumplings</a> rather than flowers</em>&quot; (花より団子 <em>hana yori dango</em>) makes fun of people who prefer to eat and drink instead of admiring the blossoms. &quot;<em>Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees!</em>&quot; (桜の樹の下には屍体が埋まっている！ <em>Sakura no ki no shita ni wa shitai ga umatte iru!</em>) is a popular <a href="proverb" title="wikilink">saying</a> about hanami, after the first line of the 1925 short story <em>&quot;Under the Cherry Trees&quot;</em> by <a href="Motojirō_Kajii" title="wikilink">Motojirō Kajii</a>.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
