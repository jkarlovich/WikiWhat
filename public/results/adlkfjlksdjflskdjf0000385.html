In modern-day Japan, <em>hanami</em> mostly consists of having an outdoor party beneath the sakura during daytime or at night. In some contexts the <a href="Sino-Japanese_vocabulary" title="wikilink">Sino-Japanese</a> term  is used instead, particularly for festivals. <em>Hanami</em> at night is called .

<p>A more ancient form of <em>hanami</em> also exists in Japan, which is enjoying the <a href="plum" class="uri" title="wikilink">plum</a> blossoms (梅 <em><a href="ume" class="uri" title="wikilink">ume</a></em>) instead, which is narrowly referred to as . This kind of <em>hanami</em> is popular among older people, because they are calmer than the sakura parties, which usually involve younger people and can sometimes be very crowded and noisy.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The practice of <em>hanami</em> is many centuries old. The custom is said to have started during the <a href="Nara_period" title="wikilink">Nara period</a> (710&amp;ndash;794) when it was <em><a href="ume" class="uri" title="wikilink">ume</a></em> blossoms that people admired in the beginning. But by the <a href="Heian_period" title="wikilink">Heian period</a> (794&amp;ndash;1185), sakura came to attract more attention and <em>hanami</em> was synonymous with sakura.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From then on, in both <a href="waka_(poetry)" title="wikilink">waka</a> and <a href="haiku" class="uri" title="wikilink">haiku</a>, &quot;flowers&quot; meant &quot;sakura.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Michael, &quot;<a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120325x1.html">Sakura: Soul of Japan</a>&quot;, &quot;<a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120325x2.html">Petals 'perfect beyond belief' stir poetic</a>&quot;, <em><a href="Japan_Times" title="wikilink">Japan Times</a></em>, 25 March 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inoki, Linda, &quot;<a href="http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fl20120325x3.html">Tracing the trees in a long national love affair</a>&quot;, <em><a href="The_Japan_Times" title="wikilink">The Japan Times</a></em>, 25 March 2012, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><em>Hanami</em> was first used as a term analogous to cherry blossom viewing in the Heian era <a href="novel" class="uri" title="wikilink">novel</a> <em><a href="The_Tale_of_Genji" title="wikilink">The Tale of Genji</a></em>. Although a <a href="wisteria" class="uri" title="wikilink">wisteria</a> viewing party was also described, the terms &quot;hanami&quot; and &quot;flower party&quot; were subsequently used only in reference to cherry blossom viewing.</p>
<p>Sakura originally was used to divine that year's harvest as well as announce the rice-planting season. People believed in <em><a href="kami" class="uri" title="wikilink">kami</a></em> inside the trees and made offerings. Afterwards, they partook of the offering with <a href="sake" class="uri" title="wikilink">sake</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Emperor_Saga" title="wikilink">Emperor Saga</a> of the Heian period adopted this practice, and held flower-viewing parties with sake and feasts underneath the blossoming boughs of sakura trees in the <a href="Imperial_Court_in_Kyoto" title="wikilink">Imperial Court in Kyoto</a>. <a href="Poetry" title="wikilink">Poems</a> would be written praising the delicate flowers, which were seen as a metaphor for life itself, luminous and beautiful yet fleeting and ephemeral. This was said to be the origin of Hanami in Japan.</p>
<p>The custom was originally limited to the elite of the Imperial Court, but soon spread to <a href="samurai" class="uri" title="wikilink">samurai</a> society and, by the <a href="Edo_period" title="wikilink">Edo period</a>, to the common people as well. <a href="Tokugawa_Yoshimune" title="wikilink">Tokugawa Yoshimune</a> planted areas of cherry blossom trees to encourage this. Under the sakura trees, people had lunch and drank sake in cheerful feasts.</p>
<p>The teasing proverb  hints at the real priorities for most cherry blossom viewers, meaning that people are more interested in the food and drinks accompanying a hanami party than actually viewing the flowers themselves.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p><em>Dead bodies are buried under the cherry trees!</em> is a popular saying about hanami, after the opening sentence of the 1925 short story &quot;Under the Cherry Trees&quot; by <a href="Motojirō_Kajii" title="wikilink">Motojirō Kajii</a>.</p>

<p>The Japanese people continue the tradition of <em>hanami</em>, gathering in great numbers wherever the flowering trees are found. Thousands of people fill the parks to hold feasts under the flowering trees, and sometimes these parties go on until late at night. In more than half of Japan, the cherry blossoming days come at the same time as the beginning of school and work after vacation, and so welcoming parties are often opened with <em>hanami</em>. Usually, people go to the parks to keep the best places to celebrate <em>hanami</em> with friends, family, and company coworkers many hours or even days before. In cities like Tokyo, it is also common to have celebrations under the sakura at night. <em>Hanami</em> at night is called <em>yozakura</em> (夜桜, literally &quot;<em>night sakura</em>&quot;). In many places such as <a href="Ueno_Park" title="wikilink">Ueno Park</a>, temporary paper lanterns are hung to have yozakura.</p>
<p>The <a href="cherry_blossom_front" title="wikilink">cherry blossom front</a> is forecast each year, previously by the <a href="Japan_Meteorological_Agency" title="wikilink">Japan Meteorological Agency</a> and now by private agencies, and is watched with attention by those who plan to celebrate hanami because the blossoms last for very little time, usually no more than two weeks. The first cherry blossoms happen in the <a href="subtropical" class="uri" title="wikilink">subtropical</a> southern islands of <a href="Okinawa" class="uri" title="wikilink">Okinawa</a>, while on the northern island of <a href="Hokkaido" class="uri" title="wikilink">Hokkaido</a>, they bloom much later. In most large cities like Tokyo, Kyoto and Osaka, the cherry blossom season normally takes place around the end of March and the beginning of April. The television and <a href="newspaper" title="wikilink">newspapers</a> closely follow this &quot;cherry blossom front&quot;, as it slowly moves from South to North.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;</p>
<p>The <em>hanami</em> celebrations usually involve eating and drinking, and playing and listening to music. Some special dishes are prepared and eaten at the occasion, like <em><a href="dango" class="uri" title="wikilink">dango</a></em> and <em><a href="bento" class="uri" title="wikilink">bento</a></em>, and <a href="sake" class="uri" title="wikilink">sake</a> is commonly drunk as part of the festivity.</p>
